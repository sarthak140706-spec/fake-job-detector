A machine learning project to detect fake job postings using NLP + BERT.

 Problem

Fake job postings are a growing problem, scamming students and job seekers. This project builds a classifier to detect and filter fake job ads to protect applicants.

 Features

 Preprocessing of job descriptions (text cleaning, tokenization)

 Embedding using BERT

 Classification with deep learning (PyTorch / TensorFlow)

 Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

 Visualization of results (confusion matrix, word clouds)

 Dataset

Kaggle Fake Job Posting Dataset

 Tech Stack

 Python

 NLP (NLTK, SpaCy, HuggingFace Transformers)

 BERT

 Scikit-learn / PyTorch

 Matplotlib / Seaborn
